# RPN-calculator

This is a project I did for my Data Structures class at Fairfield University.
An RPN calculator uses POSTFIX notation to compute expressions. We are most familiar with INFIX notation. 


This calculator works for +,-,*,/,^ 

(addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponential equations)

To test this calculator yourself, download all of the files in this repo and run the RPNTester.java class.
Have fun!


**Read about the difference between INFIX and POSTFIX notations here:


To calculate 'one plus one equals two'

You would calculate this expression on INFIX calculator by entering:
1 + 1

You would input this expression on INFIX calculator by entering:
1 1 + 

The operators follow the operands. Let's say we have multiple numbers we want to compute.
To input '(two plus four) divided by (two plus one)' we'd say:
2 4 + 2 1 + /
Which gives us an answer of 2.

This computes the two addition expressions first, then divides those sums.

This expression is also very different from '(two plus four) (divided by two) plus one'
To write this, we'd say:
2 4 + 2 / 1 +
Which gives us an answer of 4.
